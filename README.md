A Cloud Native Microservice System for Ticket Booking
This is just a small distributed microservice project, and each microservice has its own database, which you might question.Seata's SQL statement is just to be better configured so that you don't have to query the official website, it's necessary for seata because seata's transaction rollback requires it, but it's not necessary for our micro service.thanks
